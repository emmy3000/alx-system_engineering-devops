# 0x16. API Advanced

## Description:
----------------
The "0x16. API Advanced" project explores advanced concepts in working with APIs, focusing primarily on the Reddit API. It covers a range of tasks, from understanding and navigating API documentation to practical implementation of recursive API calls, pagination handling, JSON parsing, and dictionary sorting. This project provides hands-on experience in extracting and processing data from a real-world API.

## Key Concepts:
-----------------
- Reading API documentation to identify relevant endpoints.
- Utilizing API pagination to handle large data sets.
- Parsing JSON responses from APIs to extract meaningful information.
- Implementing recursive API calls for retrieving data across multiple pages.
- Sorting dictionaries based on their values.

## Project Files:
